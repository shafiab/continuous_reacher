# Project: Continuous Control (Reacher)

In this project, I trained a deep reinforcement learning agent to move a double jointed arm to target location on Unity ML-agent. Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. This particular setting is known as the [reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

Here is how the trained agent behave:
